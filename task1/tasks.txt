   1. Do exercise 9.3-1 from the book [Cormen et al., 3th edition].

   2. Solve problem 9-4 from the same book.  3. Explain briefly how
   the selection algorithms presented at the lectures could be
   modified so that they also work for multisets, i.e. so that in the
   analysis the assumption about element distinctness can be avoided.

   4. Professor Summer claims that the deterministic linear-time
   selection algorithm is hopelessly slow in practice. Prove or
   disprove his claim by performing some practical experiments with
   different types of input data. As a starting point of your
   research, you can use the code Jyrki wrote in 1999 (see enclosed
   file). In particular, can you improve Jyrki's programs?

   5. The behaviour of the random-sampling selection algorithm depends
   on the parameters alpha, beta, and gamma. Test experimentally or
   argue theoretically how these parameters should be set to achieve
   the best possible practical behaviour. The current version of
   nth_element in the CPH STL relies on random sampling so you are
   welcome to use the code available at our CVS repository when
   solving this exercise.
